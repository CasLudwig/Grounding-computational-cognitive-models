# Grounding computational cognitive models

Repository accompanying [Ludwig, Stuchl√Ω, & Malhotra](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/vur6t). 

- Code for generating Figure 4 (mixture of Gaussians example).
- Code for generating Figures 5 and C1 (simulated expanded judgement paradigm).

To do:
- Code for generating data in the expanded judgement paradigm (i.e. to generate agents' trajectories) will be added in due course.
- Update this README file with more detailed instructions for using/inspecting code.
